# Chapter 1 Review
Special numbers are Infinity & NaN and each number in JS is a fixed number of bits (64). Can write a new line 
by using \n, if you have a backslash in your string, you can also write a new line like "\\n\", and tab can be written using \t. Can compare strings. In comparing strings, uppercase letters are always less than lowercase. The && operator is only true if both values are true, the || operator is true if either value is true. Can use a ternary operator using ( ? : )

# Chapter 2 Review
Statements should end in a semicolon, otherwise, the next line might be seen as part of the line above. Keywords (like let, const, etc) & reserved words cannot be used as binding names. To call (invoke/apply) a function, use parentheses. Example: prompt(). Conditional statements use "if", "else if", "else". Form control uses "while" and "do while". For loop is similar to while loops but have conditions that it checks as it loops through. Example:
for (let num =0, num <= 12; num += 2) {
    console.log(num)
}
To break out of a loop, can insert break. If you want a loop to keep running, can use continue and it'll continue the loop's next iteration. Switch cases are similar to if/else

# Chapter 13 Review
Network protocol describes a style of communication over a network, such as email, file sharing, etc. HTTP is a protocol for getting named resources (GET req). TCP is a protocol that addresses problems with http. 
Example: Protocol: http:// Server: website.com/ Path: specific. Together looks like: http://website.com/specific
HTML is the doc format used for web pages and the head contains info about the doc and the body contains the doc itself. If tags are missing, the browser reconstructs them (like if you're missing the html, head, body tags).
Can add JS to HTML doc itself using the script tag. Can also add a src in the script tag to auto link a js file.


# Chapter 14 Review 
Document Object Model (DOM). For each box, there is an object, which we can interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents and which boxes and text it contains. Can change the structure of the DOm by changing parent child relationships.
